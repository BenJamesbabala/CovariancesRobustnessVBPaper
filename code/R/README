The code to generate the results in the paper can currently be found in
the following repositories:

https://github.com/rgiordan/LinearResponseVariationalBayes.py/tree/master/Models/LogisticGLMM
https://github.com/rgiordan/criteo
https://github.com/rgiordan/StanSensitivity
https://github.com/rgiordan/LRVBUtils

In the coming week or so, I'll clean these up, isolate what is necessary for the paper,
and make a static copy in this directory.
